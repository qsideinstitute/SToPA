RP states having problems with an exboyfrined. Heard from a  neighbor that earlier today, a vehicle with VT plates parked  by the dumpster, and an older man and child came out of the  vehicle, and circled around to the back of her apartment. RP  states that she believes that it could possibly have  something to do with her ex, as he lives in VT. RP wants the  PD aware, in case there is further activity.  19-9805  2342  Initiated - MOTOR VEHICLE STOP  CITATION  - WARNING  Call Taker  PATROL ANTHONY M DUPRAT  Location/Address  COLD SPRING RD  Unit  35  Arvd-23:42:32  Clrd-23:51:05  Vehicle  RED 2015 HOND U CRV Reg: PC VI AFX874 VIN: 2HKRM4H51FH674673  Operater  NEWSOME,  AMBER L @ 843 HEARTWELLVILLE - READSBORO, VT 05350  Race:  W  Sex: F  Refer To Citation  TL7B6068  Owner  NEWSOME,  LORI A @ 843 HEARTWELLVILLE - READSBORG, VT 05350  Race: W Sex: F  For Date:  08/07/2019  -  Wedneaday  19-9806  0023  Phone - NOISE COMPLAINT  SERVICES RENDERED  Call Taker:  MICHAEL STRIZZI  Location/Address;  [WIA 2069] LATHAM ST  Unit  35  Clrd-00:36:16  Disp-00:26:06 Enrt-00:26:50 Arvd-00:28:17  unit  34  Disp-00:26:19  Clrd-00:28:13  Unit  a4  BDisp-00:29:10 Enrt-00:29:48 Arvd-00:31:25  Cird-00:31:27  Narrative  CP states that people are talking very loud at above  addreas.
