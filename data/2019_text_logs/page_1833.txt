call # 19-12747, he found the apartment to be messy and  cluttered,  Was concerned because two children  were also at the residence.  stated Chief  instructed him to call the WPD, and the police can  follow-up with Health Inspector  I advised QE if he was concerned about the  children, as a mandated reporter, he would be required to  immediately file a verbal report with the Massachusetts  Department of Children and Families (DCF), and submit a  written report to DCF within 48-hours. I provided Jy  with the weekend contact number for DCF and advised  him the FD can aiso contact  directly if they  wish.
