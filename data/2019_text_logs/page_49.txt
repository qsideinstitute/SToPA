Narrative:  Wheeled sled tracks pulled from the grassy pull-off north of  TICcD driveway, up to the lawn of the Brook House, where  footprints entered the woods for 20 yards, but do not cross  the brook.  Same path back out back out with no attempt to  mask.  Nothing in the snow indicates anything or any animal  was removed from the area.  19-329  1151  Phone -  ALARM - BURGLAR  ALARM FOUNDED  Call Taker:  PATROL DAVID JENNINGS, D  Location/Address:  {WIA 1856] PURPLE MT PASS  Narrative:  Garage door alarm, alarm company canceled while on the  phone.  19-332  1423  Initiated - MOTOR VEHICLE STOP  CITATION - WARNING  Call Taker  PATROL DAVID JENNINGS,  D  Location/Address  COLD SPRING RD  Unit  34  Arvd-14:23:02 Clrd-14:29:36  Vehicle  BLU 2008 TOYT SH CAMRY Reg: PC MA RT66BG VIN: 4T1BB46K28U038686  Operator  ZEGMAN, HOLLIE I @ 175 PINE CONE LN - HINSDALE, MA 01235-9434  Race: W Sex: F  Refer To Citation  T1400333  Owner  ZEGMAN, ALAN J @ 175 PINE CONE LN ~ HINSDALE, MA 01235-0000  Race:  W Sex: M  19-335  1517  initiated - PARKING CHECK  SERVICES RENDERED  Call Taker:  PATROL KEVIN P GARNER  Location/Address:  PARK ST  Unit:  34  Arvd-15:17:54  Clrd-15:24:31  Narrative:  (2) violations  19-336  1520  Initiated - PARKING CHECK  SERVICES RENDERED  Call Taker:  SERGEANT DAVID R LEMIEUX  Location/Address:  SPRING ST  Unit:  31  Arvd-15:21:28  Clrd-15:27:23  19-337  1643  Initiated - MOTOR VEHICLE STOP  CITATION - WARNING  Call Taker:  PATROL KEVIN P GARNER  Location/Address:  HANCOCK RD  Unit:  34  Arvd-16:43:54 Clrd-16:50:15  Vehicle:  RED 2004 DODG PK.
