buildings.json
A collection of polygons of some (all? most?) 
buildings in Williamstown with names.

cb_2014_25_bg_500k.shp
A shapefile; geopandas fails to load this 
because of a lack of a .shx file. Maybe 
a high resolution boundary of the county (?)

county003.json
geopandas fails to load on Manuch's computer 
("not recognized as a supported file format")

county003wtown.json
geopandas fails to load on Manuch's computer.
("not recognized as a supported file format")

landuse.json
Seems to have a small collection of polygons of 
cemeteries, conservation areas, farm, recreation 
ground, "grass" 

ma.json
Map of Massachussetts with polygons of county 
boundaries. Williamstown is in the northwest corner.

ma-albers.json
*probably* a map of massachusetts since some 
of the columns refer to countyfp, statefp, 
county numbers. But, it fails to plot 
with error "'box_aspect' and 'fig_aspect' must be positive"

natural.json
Polygons with parks, forests, bodies of water.

places.json
Coordinates marking Williamstown, and six "hamlets"

planet_-73.... yadda yadda
Seems to be an agglomerated geojson file 
with all types of things within a rectangle 
of latitude/longitudes. Could be useful, 
but needs analyzing in isolation 
(and probably simplifying the file name)

points.json
A random collection of coordinates labeled 
as things with no apparent pattern? 
Some of the "types" are place_of_worship, 
viewpoint, bench, pub, water_well.

railways.json
Curves (one curve?) marking the railroad tracks.

roads.json
Collection of roads.

waterways.json
Rivers.

Williamstown.geojson
A single polygon drawing the county boundaries.
